## Zygisk Next API

Zygisk Next provides an API for injecting into init-oriented processes. See [zygisk_next_api.h](zygisk_next_api.h) for more information.

Example usage can be found in [ZygiskNextModuleSample](https://github.com/5ec1cff/ZygiskNextModuleSample).

Zygisk Next also supports application callbacks for HyperOS Rust Runtime, which are documented in [docs/hyos_runtime.md](docs/hyos_runtime.md). This is a native-only API and does not provide ART or JNI compatibility to regular Zygisk modules.
